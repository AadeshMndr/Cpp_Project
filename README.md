# Dual Numbers Library

This project provides a C++ library for dual numbers, including both standard and extended representations. Dual numbers are useful in various fields such as automatic differentiation, optimization, and computational geometry. The library supports basic arithmetic operations, standard mathematical functions, and matrix operations involving dual numbers.
